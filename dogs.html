      <h4>
        We lost little Maybe this year and we are all both thankful to have
        known her, and devastated that she is gone. She was one of a kind,
        smart, and funny. Milla and Joe miss their sister. She left us too young
        and we are left with a hole that cannot be filled. We love you Maybe,
        and we always will.
